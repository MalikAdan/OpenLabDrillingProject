# OpenLabDrillingProject
Python API for OpenLab to create a drilling program

# MalikAdan: OpenLab Drilling Project

## Purpose

Use OpenLab to automatically tag bottom and then drill 5 meters. 

## Methodology

Using the Python API for OpenLab, the program will drill up to a bit depth of around 2506 m. After the simulation, the following graphs are created:

- flow in and flow out
- hookspeed and rop
- bit depth and hole depth
- surface rpm and torque
